📘 **Project Summary: Zipf’s Law – Finding Hidden Patterns in Data**

**Team Name:** *Roomies❤️🌻* <br/>
**Team Members:** Tanima Samanta, Koyna Arya, Aparajita K Singh, Riddhi Khera

In this project, we explored **Zipf’s Law**, a statistical phenomenon commonly found in natural language datasets. The law states that in any large collection of text, the frequency of a word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. Our goal is to test this principle using real-world data and visualize the resulting patterns.

🔍 **Dataset Used:**
We analyzed the **lyrics of songs by the band COLDPLAY**. The dataset was compiled to contain a representative sample of Coldplay’s discography, offering a rich and diverse text corpus for word frequency analysis.

🛠️ **What We Did:**

* **Preprocessed the text data** by removing stopwords and punctuation and performing tokenization.
* **Calculated word frequencies** and ranked words by their occurrence.
* **Visualized Zipfian patterns** using rank-frequency and log-log plots.
* **Verified the Zipfian distribution**
* **Collaboratively coded** in Python using Google Colab and visualized results using **Matplotlib**.
* **Documented and explained** the study's theoretical foundation and practical findings.

🎯 Each team member contributed equally, focusing on research, coding, visualization, documentation, and presentation.

The final results confirmed that **Coldplay's lyrics follow Zipf’s Law**, demonstrating that even in artistic or musical text, natural language follows statistically predictable patterns.
